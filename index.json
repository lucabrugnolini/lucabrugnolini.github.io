The rule requires the signatory states to target a debt-to-GDP ratio below 60%. Within the context of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models (DSGE), we augment a fully micro-founded New-Keynesian model with a parametric linear debt consolidation rule, and we analyse the effects on the main macroeconomic aggregates. To fully understand its implications on the economy, we study different debt consolidation scenarios, allowing the excess debt to be re-absorbed with different timings. We show that including a debt consolidation rule can exacerbate the effects of the shocks in the economy by imposing a constraint on the public debt process. Secondly, we note that the effect of loosening or tightening the rule in response to a shock is heterogeneous. Shocks hitting nominal variables (monetary policy shock) are not particularly sensitive. On the contrary, we prove that the same change has a more pronounced effect in case of shock hitting real variables (productivity and public spending shocks). Finally, we show that the macroeconomic framework worsens as a function of the rigidity of the debt consolidation rule. As a limiting case, we show that the effects on output, employment, real wages, inflation, and interest rates are sizable.

The selection procedure consists in (i) select the best iBest variables according to several out-of-sample criteria and then use these variables in models that use their combination. More specifically:\n the procedure selects the best iBest variables using two different criteria (mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) included in the model as a vector fLoss of functions in the form f(Prediction,TrueValue)). This selection step is univariate, i.e. the variables are chosen by running a simple out-of-sample regression of the target variable on each variable of the dataset.\n the iBest variables are combined into set of 2, 3, \u0026hellip;, iBest variables. For each of these sets, the model is estimated and then avaluated out-of-sample. The best model is the one with the lowest out-of-sample MSE. We also augment each model with the first principal component of all variable in the dataset. Thus, there are a total of 2 (2^iBest) models.\n  The complexity is O((T-Ts)*2^iBest) where T is the sample size, Ts is the number of observation in the initial estimation window.\nExample Forecasting US non-farm-payroll one and two months ahead H = [1,2] using a dataset containing 116 US variables taken from McCracken and Ng (2015). iBest is set to 16.
